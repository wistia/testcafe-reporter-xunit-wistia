# testcafe-reporter-xunit-wistia
Slightly enhanced version of the testcafe-reporter-xunit reporter

This is a slightly enhanced version of the testcafe-reporter-xunit reporter. When a test fails, it reports the approximate time in the browserstack video when the test case starts and ends to make finding that test in the video easier.
